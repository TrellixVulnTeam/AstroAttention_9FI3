### Python examples

The Attention.ipynb is a minimally working example of a CNN using *attention* and uses the functions from [the sononet attention github repo](https://github.com/ozan-oktay/Attention-Gated-Networks) and the FRDEEPF Pytorch class from [here](https://hongmingtang060313.github.io/FR-DEEP/).

It runs, but it **does not work well at the moment**. It probably requires significant data augmentation because the basic FRDEEPF dataset is pretty small. 

At the moment it implements the attention function from the [sononet paper](https://github.com/as595/Attention-MSc/blob/master/PAPERS/sononet.pdf).
